6 Basic Elements of Visual Design

1. Lines - help to create shapes, create and divide sections
2. Shapes - self container areas composed of colors, shapes, etc. Self container objects
3. Color - color helps diferentiate shapes, add depth and emphasis, and establish a brand experience, and can help show emotions and feelings
4. Texture - used to attract or divert attention from content
5. Typography - fonts, and colors and styles. How the words are organized, styled, and presented on the web page
6. Form - gives the illusion of 3 dimensional objects, add depth and texture

7 Principals of Visual Design

1. Balance - is the arranment and distribution of objects to create meaning
2. Rythym - is the repitition of elements and creates movements and patterns
3. Porportion - also know as scale and how each element relates in size
4. Space - also known as white space where you let the design breath creating impact with quietness
5. Dominace - is the focal point achieved in size, color, shape, and etc. it is used to indicate a primary message
6. Heiarchy - differentiates primary and secondary focus and achived thus size, color, and placement
7. Unity - the big picture of the design, how everything comes together

- The C.R.A.P Principals

It really means Contrast, Repitition, Alignment, & Proximity

- Contrast allows the user to easily differentiate elements, it creates flow and gives more meaning to a design
- Repitition creates consistancy between elements, style thru the design, and a cohesive feel which helps guide the user
- Alignment creates a clear relationship between elements, nothing should feel out of place (unless its intentonally so)
- Proximity creates a clear relationship between elements, in that grouped elements are typical together or similar,

So before starting a web site design, think..."Oh crap"

- Typography 101

Typography is what language looks like.

Serif vs Sans Serif (Sans is french for 'without' meaning a font without the serif)

As far as alignment, when it doubt always left align, especially for large bodies of text

You can center align headings and sub headings, but typicall never center align large bodies of text

Line Length - optimal line length if 50 to 60 and some may say 75 characters per line. Its easier to read and will reduce eye fatigue

Line Height - also called letting - is the verticle space betwen text. Aim for 100% to 130% line height for body copy

And 80% to 100% for large headings.

Other terms

Kerning - the space between individual characters
Tracking - all the overall space between characters in a line of text

Fonts can also emote feelings and context - so the wrong font can be problomatic

Like a silly kiddy font wouldn't look good for a Muesum or a Company Website, but the site for a childrens book or something it would be fine.

NEVER USE COMIC SANS

Color Theory -

Color gives your design meaning and helps create emotions.

When looking for color ideas, weirdly avoid Primary colors as my primary colors.

Choose one dominate color, and when in doubt, stick with Black and White and add an accent color

Grids - 4 main approaches to grid based designs

1. Single Column
2. Multi Column
3. Modular
4. Hierarchical

grids create order by distingusihing different types of information

- Block, Inline, & Inline Block -
  The majority of HTML elements are defined as block level elements or as inline elements.

a block level element takes up a whole line in the browser, from edge to edge, and includes a line break after the element.

Some examples of block elements are <h1>, <p>, <ul>, <table>

Inline elements do not take up a whole line, they have no line break, and are only as wide as the content within the element.

These elements would also stack side by side

Some examples of inline elements are <a>, <img>, <span>

Inline-Block elements are a hybrid mix of inline and block elements. Like an inline element, the box is only as wide as the content, but like a block element, the elements sit on their own line, so all other elements appear below the element.

inline block elements can also be defined within CSS
display: inline-block
